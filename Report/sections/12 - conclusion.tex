\section{Conclusion}

The completion of Phase 3 of the project signifies a major milestone in the learning journey of database systems. By designing and implementing a database in PostgreSQL, we have gained practical experience in utilizing key database management features, including creating and enforcing constraints, writing complex queries, and applying advanced functionalities like triggers and stored procedures. This phase not only consolidates theoretical knowledge but also equips students with the technical skills required to design efficient, secure, and reliable database systems for diverse applications.
