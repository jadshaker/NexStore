\subsection{Entity Types and Their Attributes}

\subsubsection{Branch}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/entities/branch.png}
  \caption{\textit{Branch Entity and its Attributes}}
\end{figure}

The branch is one of the main entities presented in the ER diagram. The phone number was the primary key chosen to uniquely identify each branch. Additionally, the work hours were selected to be a composite multi-valued attribute since each branch might have different work hours depending on the weekday (e.g., weekends have different work hours). It comprises the weekday and the opening and closing hours of the branch. We included the composite attribute address to indicate the accurate address of the branch. Finally, we added the name attribute that indicates the name of each branch.

\subsubsection{Category}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/entities/category.png}
  \caption{\textit{Category Entity and its Attributes}}
\end{figure}

As it is essential to know the category of each product, we include the category entity. It contains the Name of the category as a primary key in addition to the description of the category.

\subsubsection{Coupon}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/entities/coupon.png}
  \caption{\textit{Coupon Entity and its Attributes}}
\end{figure}

In several events, a coupon might be applied to the order. The coupon can be identified by its unique code, so we chose the code to be the key attribute. Each coupon can be applied a certain number of times on a specific amount ranging from a minimum to a maximum, so we added the four attributes: "Times used", "Usage limit"," Minimum order amount" and "Maximum order amount". Furthermore, since each coupon is valid for a specific time interval, we included the "Valid to" and "Valid from" attributes. Finally, we added the attributes "Discount percent" and "Description" to indicate the discount percentage and the description of each coupon.

\subsubsection{Customer}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/entities/customer.png}
  \caption{\textit{Customer Entity and its Attributes}}
\end{figure}

This entity describes all the information we need to know about the customer comprising several attributes. We chose the phone number of the customer to be the primary key since it uniquely identifies each customer. Additionally, we included the name of the customer as a composite attribute as it contains the first and last name. Similarly, we added the address attribute that consists of the county, state, city, street, building, and apartment of the customer. Moreover, we added the password hashed to ensure security. Furthermore, we added the email attribute to ensure communication between the customer and the store. Finally, we added the gender, registration date, and date of birth of the customer that can be used for special events such as the customer's birthday.

\subsubsection{Department}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/entities/department.png}
  \caption{\textit{Department Entity and its Attributes}}
\end{figure}

This entity represents the departments in the company. Each department might have several locations, so this attribute was multi-valued. Since each department has a unique name, we chose the name to be the key attribute. Finally, we added the derived attribute "number of employees" to keep track of the updated number of employees in each department.

\subsubsection{Dependent}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/entities/dependent.png}
  \caption{\textit{Dependent Entity and its Attributes}}
\end{figure}

Each employee has dependents that are related to them. Since we cannot have a dependent without having an employee, we set the dependent entity to be weak with the name attribute as a weak attribute of it.

\subsubsection{Driver}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/entities/driver.png}
  \caption{\textit{Driver Entity and its Attributes}}
\end{figure}

To deliver an online order, a driver needs to be assigned. This driver entity has the license number as a primary key since it uniquely identifies the driver. Additionally, other attributes reflecting information about the driver are the driving experience years and the license expiry date.

\subsubsection{Employee}
\begin{figure}[H]

One of the basic entities in this project is the employee entity which portrays all the information needed about the employee. We chose the social security number (SSN) of the employee as the primary key since it uniquely identifies each employee. Additionally, we added the address attribute that consists of the county, state, city, street, building, and apartment of the employee. Moreover, we included the name of the customer as a composite attribute as it contains the first and last name. Finally, we added all the information needed such as date of birth, phone number, position, gender, email address, salary, and hire date to keep an eye on this important personal information.

\subsubsection{Order}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/entities/order.png}
  \caption{\textit{Order Entity and its Attributes}}
\end{figure}

To proceed with the customers' orders on both physical and online channels, the order entity was added. The primary key of this entity is the unique order ID. Other attributes include the total cost of the order, the payment method used, and any notes for this order. Finally, we added the "is online" attribute to specify whether the order was conducted physically or online.

\subsubsection{Product}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/entities/product.png}
  \caption{\textit{Product Entity and its Attributes}}
\end{figure}

This product entity describes all the information we need to know about the product comprising several attributes. We set the product entity as a weak entity since it doesn't exist without the dependence on the branch entity. We chose the stock-keeping unit (SKU) of the product as the primary key since it uniquely identifies each product. Additionally, we included the dimensions of the product as a composite attribute as it contains the height, width, and length of the product. Moreover, we added the colors as a multi-valued attribute since one product could have various colors. Similarly, we added the image URLs as a multi-valued attribute since a product could have several images to cast it online. Furthermore, we added the weight to keep track of the total weight of the shipment. In addition, we used the quantity to view the available amount of this product. Finally, we added the name, description, price, brand, and the date when the product was added to specify these essential parameters of each product.

\subsubsection{Supplier}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/entities/supplier.png}

\end{figure}

To keep up with the customers' complaints, a support ticket entity was needed. We used the ticket ID as a primary key as it uniquely identifies the support ticket. Moreover, other attributes like subject, description, priority -to know how urgent the request is-, and status to keep track of it were needed.

\subsection{Relationships and their Explanations}

\subsubsection{Assigned To}
\begin{figure}[H]
